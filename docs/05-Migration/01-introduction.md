We are continuously working on new features, catching bugs and improving our architecture.
To get the latest changes to you faster, our pipeline produces releases quite often.
You can always find the latest version on [GitHub](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/diva/releases).
On this page we provide all the necessary knowledge you need to always keep DIVA up to date.

We recommend that you always use the latest stable version of DIVA.
The latest version of the source code can always be found in the [main](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/diva/tree/main) branch.
The latest unstable development state can be found in [dev](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/diva/tree/dev) branch.

In most cases you can safely use the newer patch or minor version of DIVA.
However, it is possible that we may change the internal infrastructure or add new features.
Then the existing data in your DIVA instance should also be brought up to date.
Most migrations are **mandatory**.

The update of the major version indicates a breaking change and the migration is necessary to guarantee the operability of the system.
