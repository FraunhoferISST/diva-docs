:::info WIP
We are working on providing you with a comprehensive guide to source code writing. Stay tuned!

## JavaScript

All JavaScript must adhere to [ESLint Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](#https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#types).
Always use ESLint to format your code before submitting a PR. Additionally, we prefer Arrow Function definition with `const`:

```javascript
const someFunction = () => {}
```

### Vue.js Styleguide

Our Vue.js code follows the [ESLint Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](#https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#types) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) rules. Always use ESLint to format your components before submitting a PR.
