## ‚ö†Ô∏è Delete User

If you want to delete your user account, click on `Delete account` while editing your user data.

:::caution
This will only delete your user data in our **DIVA** system.
You are still able to log into the identity management system provided by **Keycloak**.
If you sign in again, **DIVA** will create a new internal account.
Everything done with your old, deleted account is not related to this new one.

üî® We try to improve this behavior in future releases.

## See other users accounts

You can also view the details of other users.
To do this, you need to click on the name of the corresponding user.
You will see other users in several places in the application.
For example, you can find the data owner or the creator of a resource on the [resource details](./details/general-metadata) page.
