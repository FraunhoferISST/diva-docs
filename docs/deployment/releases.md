# Releases and Migrations

We are continuously working on new features, catching bugs and improving our architecture.
To get the latest changes to you faster, our pipeline produces releases quite often.
You can always find the latest version on [GitHub](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/diva/releases).
On this page we provide all the necessary knowledge you need to always keep DIVA up to date.

We recommend that you always use the latest stable version of DIVA.
The latest version of the source code can always be found in the [main](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/diva/tree/main) branch.
The latest unstable development state can be found in [dev](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/diva/tree/dev) branch.

In most cases you can safely use the newer patch or minor version of DIVA.
However, it is possible that we may change the internal infrastructure or add new features.
Then the existing data in your DIVA instance should also be brought up to date.
Most migrations are **mandatory**.

The update of the major version indicates a breaking change and the migration is necessary to guarantee the operability of the system.

## Upgrade to the latest version

To bring DIVA up to date, simply download the latest Docker distribution `docker-deployment.zip` from the [release page](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/diva/releases).
In both cases navigate to `docker/` directory to execute the start script:

```bash
./up_core.sh
```

## Migration execution

To prepare for the migration, deploy the target DIVA version and then execute the migration, if available.
Make sure your DIVA instance is not actively used in a production environment until the migration is completed to avoid potential inconsistencies.

We ship DIVA with a migration Docker service that you can also find in the `docker/` directory.
This service is attached to two specific versions, for which the migration is intended.
Since not all releases need a migration, you may not find a migration service for a particular version.
If you want to upgrade from an older version, you must run all intermediate migrations sequentially.
For example, to upgrade from `v3.0.3` to `3.2.0`, you have to deploy `3.2.0` and execute the migration for `3.1.0`.

Execute the migration service with the following:

```sh
./migrate.sh
```

::: warning
Make a snapshot of your DIVA environment. It should be ok to save the volumes.
:::

::: warning
After a successful execution, the service should not be executed again, as this may cause undesired side effects.
