# Introduction

This is an ongoing project of the [Data Business](https://www.isst.fraunhofer.de/de/geschaeftsfelder/datenwirtschaft.html) 
department of the [Fraunhofer ISST](https://www.isst.fraunhofer.de/). Data is getting more and more important to companies. 
By utilizing the right data, companies can get more productive and will be able to succeed their competitors. 
Thus, we believe it is time for a data management solution, that evaluates new innovative solutions to support companies 
in their daily work with data. This tool will grow day by day, and we try our best to tackle data management challenges in companies.

We also use this tool as a playground for our students, where they can work out topics for their bachelor or master thesis. 
Even the PhD students profit from this tool as a platform for their doctoral thesis.

In this guide, we will go through the main building blocks of the DIVA Ecosystem, 
prepare the environment for DIVA and learn how to deploy it with Docker.
