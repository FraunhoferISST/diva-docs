# Search Page

On the search page you can search for all [Resources](../about/README.md#resource) and [Assets](../about/README.md#asset) in DIVA using free text search.
Just enter your query in the search field, the search will be executed as you type.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img class="rounded-lg" :src="$withBase('/assets/screenshots/search.png')" alt="DIVA login">
</div>

The search results are presented in cards with an overview of important meta information. When clicking on a card, the [details](./resource-details) page of a resource or asset opens in a new tab.

1. Hash icon
2. Title of the Resource/Asset
