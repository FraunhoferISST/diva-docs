# Search Page

On the search page you can search for all [Resources](../about/README.md#resource) and [Assets](../about/README.md#asset) in DIVA using free text search.
Just enter your query in the search field, the search will be executed as you type.
DIVA will already give a first set of results without you having to insert a search term.
This should support you in "flowing" through the metadata.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img class="rounded-lg" :src="$withBase('/assets/screenshots/search.png')" alt="DIVA login">
</div>

The search results are presented in cards with an overview of important meta information.
When clicking on a card, the [details](./resource-details) page of a resource or asset opens in a new tab.

Following information is previewed if available:

1. Title
2. Description
3. Type of result (e.g. `resource`, `asset`)
4. Metadata create and modified date
5. Keywords

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img class="rounded-lg border-2 border-gray-100 border-solid" :src="$withBase('/assets/screenshots/search_result.png')" alt="DIVA Search Result">
</div>

::: warning
The current search page is very minimalistic.
In the future updates we will enhance the search and enable more complex search scenarios.
Like filtering resources by a specific file types.
