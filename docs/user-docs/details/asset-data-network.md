# Asset Data Network

In this view, you can link entities to your asset.
This allows you to group your data.
Click on the **+** symbol.
After that, you can use a text search to find the entities you want to add to the asset.
You can attach resources, users and other assets.
Added entities can also be removed again.
To do this, click on an entity and an **-** icon will appear, which you must click on.

::: tip Future Work
We are always trying to develop features further.
In the future we will work on the possibility to add not only one layer, but to create a complete data network with labeled edges.
This should allow you to navigate through your data network much easier.
