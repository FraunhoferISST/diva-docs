# General Metadata

## General Page

This page is the same for all types of resources.
To edit a field, just click on it and the edit mode will be activated.
Make your change and click the checkmark icon to save them.
The following metadata can be edited:

|Property|Description|

|**data owner**|Currently only people that signed into DIVA at least once can be selected|
|**planned availability level**| This property indicates how long it is planned to keep the Distribution of the Entity available (**stable**, **available**, **experimental**, **temporary**)|

|**location**|We offer a map on which points or regions can be drawn visually. The semantic meaning of a location may differ depending on the entity and may need to be explained in the description.|

:::tip Rating
The **rating** field is the only one you can not edit.
It will be automatically set according to the reviews made by the users.
We will change this in the future, as it seems rather confusing.

## Cost Page

Currently, 4 types of costs can be identified.
You can also specify, in addition to the costs, whether they are in $ or â‚¬.

## History Page

All changes to the metadata are saved in DIVA.
It is stored which user has made changes to which fields and when.
If an automated profiling was performed, the initiating user is also recorded as the one who made changes.

:::tip
The history has a very technical character.
This is due to the fact that we can store a very large amount of metadata in the catalog.
Presenting every single metadata field in the history in a human-readable way would currently lead to an enormous additional effort.

If larger parts of the metadata are changed, the details are hidden for the time being.
Each entry has a button with 3 dots.
The details can be displayed via this button.
There you can also expand and examine the technical data further.

## Reviews Page

Users can rate a resource or asset.
For this you can give a 1-5 star rating and add a suitable rating text.
Users can also edit or completely delete their rating after creating it.
For this you need to click on the pen or bin icon.
The overall rating is the average of all ratings of the resource or asset.
