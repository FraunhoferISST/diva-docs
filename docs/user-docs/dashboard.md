# Dashboard

The dashboard offers a number of pre-built metrics for inspection.
So far, the most important key figures are presented via the number of resources, assets, users and reviews.
Additionally, there are first diagrams about the distribution of resource types.

::: tip
To extend the dashboard, a developer must be consulted.
Metrics must be based on the metadata stored in DIVA.
