With the release of DIVA v4.0.0 that changed and an extensive data governance toolset was introduced. For this we added policies and rules as new entities which are used by the two new services business-decision-point and business-rules-executor to enforce platform-wide behaviour, particularly with respect to data. Rules and policies are entities and are therefore managed by the entity-management-service and stored in the MongoDB. In the next few pages, we will explain the concept behind rules and policies and how they are loaded and stored in more detail.","sidebar":"divaSidebar"},"Development/Data Governance/policies":{"id":"Development/Data Governance/policies","title":"Policies","description":"As explained in the Introduction to Data Governance in the DIVA ecosystem, policies are a set of conditions that allow a query to be executed with a certain scope. For the task of restricting access and enforcing policies, we provide a policy decision service similar to popular solutions such as Open Policy Agent or Oso. What distinguishes our solution from the alternatives is its scope, i.e., its wide-ranging and generic configuration options and, in particular, deeper capabilities for incorporating input data into the decision-making process. Since we provide a variety of ways to query the different data sources on the platform and the fields included in the requests, a good understanding of DIVAs architecture is recommended before starting to work on policies.","sidebar":"divaSidebar"},"Development/Data Governance/rules":{"id":"Development/Data Governance/rules","title":"Rules","description":"DIVA provides an RESTful API that allows an administrator to create, update and delete so called business rules. Business rules can be used to define specific reactions to events on the platform. For example, they are used to delete reviews for entities when the entity to which the review refers is deleted.","sidebar":"divaSidebar"},"Development/docker-development":{"id":"Development/docker-development","title":"Docker Development","description":"DIVA is built with a focus on scalability, modularization and expandability using a microservice architecture.","sidebar":"divaSidebar"},"Development/local-development":{"id":"Development/local-development","title":"Local Development","description":"In this chapter we will look at what is needed to develop existing services or create new ones locally on your own development machine.","sidebar":"divaSidebar"},"Development/prerequisites":{"id":"Development/prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","description":"Here we will explain how we set up most optimal environment for DIVA development and deployment.","sidebar":"divaSidebar"},"Introduction/quick-start":{"id":"Introduction/quick-start","title":"Quick Start","description":"The fastest way to get you up and running is by following the Deployment Guide.","sidebar":"divaSidebar"},"Introduction/what-is-diva":{"id":"Introduction/what-is-diva","title":"What is DIVA?","description":"The documentation is in the early stages and will be continuously enhanced.
